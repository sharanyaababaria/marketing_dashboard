# As part of a group project in college, we were assigned the task of creating a simulated dataset for a fast-food restaurant, divided into three business segments. My focus was on the marketing division. I constructed a dataset in Excel, incorporating realistic variables for the  marketing division of a fast-food restaurant.
# Using Power BI, I developed a comprehensive marketing dashboard to visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) and other insights derived from the dataset. The dashboard includes essential metrics such as Average Sales Lift per Promotion Type, Footfall Efficiency, and Cost Efficiency Ratio. Additionally, it features monthly trends in revenue and cost, revenue distribution by menu item, and profit margins across various dishes.
# I incorporated insights into ROMI (Return on Marketing Investment) across different revenue categories, highlighting that the high-revenue category exhibited the lowest ROMI, while the medium-revenue category had the highest. Additionally, the dashboard includes visualizations of cost efficiency, noting that 69% of costs effectively contribute to revenue generation, with steak as the highest revenue item and burgers achieving the highest profit margin.
